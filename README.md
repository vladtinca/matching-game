# match-game

Match Game is a memory matching cards game build using React.

First 6 picture pairs are locally stored.
Each time a new game is started, 1 pair is replaced with a new one, fetching data from "https://dog.ceo/dog-api/"

You can relax your highly agitated neurons by looking at pictures of silly dogs.
